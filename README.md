## Setup

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana-transactions-monitor.git
   cd solana-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Configuration

- **Set Wallet Address**

  Open the `transactions.service.ts` file and set your desired wallet address on **line 38**:

  ```typescript
  const walletAddress = 'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE';
  ```

- **Environment Variables**

  Ensure you have a `.env` file with the following variables:

  ```dotenv
  HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_api_key
  ```

- **Output of processed data and history in real time on terminal log**

  After starting the dev server and inputting the desired wallet address, you can see the output in the terminal log in real time

## Usage

- **Real-Time Transactions**

  The service logs all processed real-time transactions and their history directly in the terminal.

- **Polling Mechanism**

  A polling mechanism is implemented to periodically retrieve and process transaction data from Helius RPC.

## Polling Mechanism

The service uses a polling mechanism to fetch and process transactions at regular intervals, ensuring that real-time data is continuously monitored and updated.

## Additional Design Questions

### What are some issues that could occur with watching transactions in real-time that then need to be processed downstream? What are some strategies you would use to deal with these issues?

**Issues:**

1. **High Throughput:** Handling a large number of transactions can overwhelm the system.
2. **Data Consistency:** Ensuring that all transactions are accurately processed without duplication or loss.
3. **Latency:** Delays in processing can lead to outdated information.
4. **Error Handling:** Managing failures in transaction fetching or processing without disrupting the entire system.
5. **Scalability:** Scaling the system to handle increasing transaction volumes efficiently.

**Strategies:**

1. **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Control the number of transactions processed per unit time to prevent system overload.
2. **Reliable Queuing Systems:** Implement message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to ensure transactions are processed in order and without loss.
3. **Idempotent Processing:** Design processing logic to handle duplicate transactions gracefully.
4. **Error Logging and Retries:** Implement robust error handling with retry mechanisms for transient failures.
5. **Horizontal Scaling:** Distribute the workload across multiple instances or services to manage higher volumes.
6. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Continuously monitor system performance and set up alerts for anomalies or failures.

### What is your suggested tech stack / architecture for this service?

**Suggested Tech Stack:**

- **Backend Framework:** NestJS for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Helius RPC for accessing Solana blockchain data.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing processed transactions and metadata.
- **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for handling transaction processing asynchronously.
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io) for pushing real-time updates to clients.
- **Authentication:** JWT or OAuth2 for securing API endpoints.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring and visualization.
- **Containerization:** Docker for deploying and managing service instances.

**Architecture Overview:**

1. **API Layer:** NestJS controllers handle incoming requests and route them to services.
2. **Service Layer:** Services interact with Helius RPC to fetch transactions and process them.
3. **Processing Layer:** A message queue manages the flow of transactions for asynchronous processing.
4. **Data Layer:** Processed transactions are stored in a database for persistence and historical queries.
5. **Real-Time Layer:** WebSockets provide real-time updates to clients about new transactions.
6. **Monitoring Layer:** Tools like Prometheus monitor system health, while Grafana visualizes metrics.

## Why Polling Mechanism

While WebSockets offer real-time communication by maintaining an open connection between the client and server, a polling mechanism was chosen for this project due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. Polling allows the server to periodically check for new transactions without the overhead of managing persistent connections, making it suitable for scenarios with moderate real-time requirements and simpler infrastructure needs.
